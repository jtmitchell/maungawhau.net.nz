## Client: Stellar Software
### September 2012 to February 2013

We worked with [StellarLibrary](http://www.stellarlibrary.com)
to extend the capabilities of their backend administration. 
<!--more-->

These included a new Reseller capability,
and automatic foreign exchange conversion for invoices and receipts.

On the user-facing site, we implemented some routines that used ImageMagick to 
manipulate PDF document thumbnails, and customised folder images.
