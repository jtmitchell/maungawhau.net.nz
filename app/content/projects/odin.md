In just under a year with [Odin Solutions](http://www.odinsol.com/)
we worked on two large client-facing projects and an internal product.
We worked closely with the New Zealand team to standardise practices in
automated testing, Jenkins CI deployments, and code delivery.

The first project was to customise the open source [Revive Adserver](https://www.revive-adserver.com/)
to capture and report on the metrics they required for campaigns, and to simplify the data entry
for entering their ads.

The other major project was to create a brand new site for the [UK Health Lottery](https://www.healthlottery.co.uk/).

This involved writing a bespoke CMS backend in Node.js to serve the whole site,
and AngularJS components to add interactivity to pages by calling the server API.

![List of CMS content](/images/projects/odin-thl-winners.jpg "List of CMS content")

CMS content was required for articles about recent winners and news about the causes supported by the lottery.

![Lookup results](/images/projects/odin-thl-results.jpg "Lookup results")

The AngularJS components handled interactive tasks, such as the retrieval and display of results,
and the ability to find nearby retailers.
