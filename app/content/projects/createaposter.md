## Client: Fujifilm NZ
### December 2009 to July 2012

After starting with the wrappz.co.nz site, we continued working with Fujifilm NZ
to create new shopping sites.
<!--more-->

Projects that went live are [Create A Poster](http://afl.createaposter.com.au)
and [The Corner Dairy](http://www.thecornerdairy.co.nz).

For [Create A Poster](http://afl.createaposter.com.au) we needed to make the clubs pages use the club logo
colours.
![Club Page - background and logo vary according to the club](images/projects/createaposter.com.au-suns.png)

Then we needed a dynamic way to show what poster you are buying as you select your customisable options.

![Custom Poster - choose a background](images/projects/createaposter.com.au-bartel-bkg.png)
![Custom Poster - choose a style for the name](images/projects/createaposter.com.au-bartel-name.png)
![Custom Poster - choose another combination](images/projects/createaposter.com.au-bartel-other.png)


Projects that did not make it into production are a cartoon site, a chemicals site, and a book covers site.

These new projects were developed in Python + Django + Satchmo (providing
a pre-built shopping cart).
