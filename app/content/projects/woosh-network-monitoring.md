## Client: Woosh Wireless
### November 2003 to June 2004


We developed scripts and a database to store and graph SNMP data
from the IPWireless equipment.

We also developed a Web services interface to the DNS system using Perl and
SOAP.
The interface allowed the DNS functions to be accessed from the
corportate Microsoft platform and through the web site.
