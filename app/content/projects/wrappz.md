We worked on the Wrappz.co.nz project (using PHP and MySQL), to cleanup code licensed from the U.K.
and implement the NZ website [www.wrappz.co.nz](http://www.wrappz.co.nz).

Over about a month we simplified the code, and implemented a single shopping cart
for the site. 

During 2010 we completely overhauled the backend administration,
changed the frontend to allow easy regional re-skinning of the site, and added
new features such as gift cards, commissions for artists.

A skinned version of the site was deployed for the Australian market, and we had versions available for various other markets.

Here is a page showing an artist image. Notice how the sample in the lower right is wrapped onto the demo devices.

Here are the pre-built covers for the iPhone 4. The image samples change when the selection is changed.
