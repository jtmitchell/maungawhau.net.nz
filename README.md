## Overview

This is the source for the [Maungawhau IT](http://www.maungawhau.net.nz) static website. The site is generated from markdown files and uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket for serving to the web.


## Inspiration

The base html is based on [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/releases/latest).

This originally used [hyde](http://hyde.github.io/) to generate the static site.
That changed when I moved to Web Starter Kit, which is gulp based, and so I also moved to a gulp workflow.

Many thanks to Sean Farrell and Daniel Naab for their excellent posts and code about using gulp to transform markdown into static html pages.
