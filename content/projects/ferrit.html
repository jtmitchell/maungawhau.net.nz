{% mark excerpt -%}
We worked on Telecom's Ferrit online shopping site to deliver new capabilities, such as search and direct bank deposit payments,
and to support the huge Perl-based application.

Part of the support was the streamline the deployments onto the production servers, and to create a solution using Virtual Machines
for staff to run their own test versions of the whole site.
