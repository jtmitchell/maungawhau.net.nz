{% mark excerpt -%}

We performed "proof of concept" testing for a Linux-based solution to
implement new client services. 

{%- endmark %}


The work involved gathering requirements and identifying the scope of the
testing; setting up a database and writing scripts to perform the
functions; and working through the test plan.

At the end of the tests we supplied the customer
with results and conclusions, requirements and 
design documents, and a tender for implementing the services on a Linux
server.
