[Yellow Pages](http://yellow.co.nz)
has had a visual refresh, and we have continued to improve the reviews 
features, and extend the user experience with photo uploads, bookmarking and saving searches.
{%- endmark %}

We have also spent time improving the search within the site, and
tagging business pages with Google-friendly metadata and schemas.
